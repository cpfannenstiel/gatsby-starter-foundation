# <My Name> Writing Portfolio
  
Below are articles I have written that are published or that are intended for future publication in academic journals. These examples are ranging from aricles published during a journalistic internship with Bozeman Magazine to writing done while pursing my Masters in Rhetoric. Aditionally, I have included some creative writing portfolios from a project in non-fiction memoir writing as well as graduate level research articles and book reviews.

This set of articles was featured in the local media publisher Bozeman Magazine while pursuing my undergraduate degree at Montana State University. Included are a range of local interests topics surroundings events, charity organizations and the city's involvement with contemporary social movements.

These were a series of Instagram posts I did for the Women's Ultimate Frisbee Club team at Carnegie Mellon. I designed the graphics and captions. Some graphics were designed to also be shared on the club's Facebook page.

This was one of the monthly newsletters I created for subscribers at Development Dimensions International. The newsletter was to let them know of recent blogs, podcast, or events we hosted and upcoming webinars they could attend. I worked with a graphic artist to prepare the content.
