# Who am I?

I am a Masters student studying rhetoric at Carnegie Mellon University. My main research interests lie in the cultural studies side of rhetoric, specifically with Asian American rhetorics. I am interested in narrative and storytelling as a way into the experiences.

My career goals consist of working in publishing as an editor. I have experience working as a bookseller and really enjoyed the customer-side of the book world, now I am interested in the back end of book publishing.

What I Do?

In the fall of 2022 I worked for CMU ETC Press, an open source academic publishing house focused on games and technology. I currently work as a Communication and Language Support Consultant at CMU's Communication and Language Support Center, a part of the Student Academic Success Center.
